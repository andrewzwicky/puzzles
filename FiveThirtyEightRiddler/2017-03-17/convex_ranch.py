# From Stephen Carrier, a puzzle about domestic boundaries:
# Consider four square-shaped ranches, arranged in a two-by-two pattern,
# as if part of a larger checkerboard. One family lives on each ranch, and
# each family builds a small house independently at a random place within
# the property. Later, as the families in adjacent quadrants become acquainted,
# they construct straight-line paths between the houses that go across the
# boundaries between the ranches, four in total. These paths form a quadrilateral
# circuit path connecting all four houses. This circuit path is also the boundary
# of the area where the familiesâ€™ children are allowed to roam.
# What is the probability that the children are able to travel in a straight line
# from any allowed place to any other allowed place without leaving the boundaries?
# (In other words, what is the probability that the quadrilateral is convex?)
