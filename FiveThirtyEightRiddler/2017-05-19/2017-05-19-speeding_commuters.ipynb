Each of the drivers has a lead foot, and each has a chance of being ticketed for speeding. Driver A has a 10 percent chance of getting a ticket each time he drives, Driver B a 15 percent chance, Driver C a 20 percent chance, and Driver D a 25 percent chance. The state will immediately revoke the license of a driver after his or her third ticket, and a driver will stop driving in the carpool once his license is revoked. Since there is only one police officer on the carpool rout, a maximum of one ticket will be issued per morning and a max of one per evening.    \n",

    "# Observations\n",
    "First, let's make some observations about the problem.  At the beginning of each trip, each driver will have some amount of tickets.  I'm going to refer to these amounts as a **state**.  For example, if Drivers A & B each had 1 ticket, I'll write that state as `[1, 1, 0, 0]`. The intial state is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. There are a limited number of states\n",
    "Each driver starts with 0 tickets and stops receiving them after their 3rd.  Because there is a cap on the amount of tickets, and a fixed number of drivers, there is a finite number of ways that tickets can be distributed amongst our drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual number of states is the number of ways that 0, 1, 2, or 3 can be arranged, including repeats, across the 4 drivers.  With 4 possible ticket amounts over 4 drivers, this will result in $$4^4$$ or 256 unique states.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. The probability for a ticket to be issued depends only on the state at that time.\n",
    "If Driver A and Driver B each have 1 ticket, the probability that Driver C will receive a ticket is the same no matter the order that A and B received their tickets.  The only factors that influence each driver's probability of receiving a ticket are:\n",
    "* the number of drivers remaining (more drivers means it's less likely that any particular driver will be selected)\n",
    "* their individual ticket probability\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. The state where all drivers have received the maximum number of tickets can be reached from any other state\n",
    "The end state is the one where all drivers have received their maximum number of tickets, `[3, 3, 3, 3]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I selected a distribution of tickets at random, e.g. `[0, 1, 2, 0]`, it's possible to reach the end state by issuing tickets.  No matter which state we pick, we can always make our way to the end state.  This is probably the most abstract of all of these observations, but it's important to the solution, so stick around!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### In summary:\n",
    "1. the number of states (ticket distributions) is finite.\n",
    "2. the probability for a ticket to be issued depends only on the state at that time.\n",
    "3. there is an end state that can be reached from any other state."

    "# Markov Chains\n",
    "\n",
    "These observations lead me to think that describing this scenario as a [Markov chains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) might be a good method to solve this problem.  A *Markov process* is a process with some randomness that doesn't depend on previous state, i.e. it is \"memoryless\".  A *Markov chain* is a way to represent one of these processes, given it has a finite number of states.\n",
    "\n",
    "As an example, let's pretend tomorrow's weather depends only on today's weather, and there are only two types of weather, **rainy** or **sunny**.  The weather follows these rules:\n",
    "* If it's sunny today, tommorow's weather is: \n",
    "  * 90% likely sunny.\n",
    "  * 10% likely rainy.\n",
    "* If it's rainy today, tommorow's weather is: \n",
    "  * 50% likely sunny.\n",
    "  * 50% likely rainy.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be visualized like this:\n",
    "![weather_markov](Markov_Chain_weather_model_matrix_as_a_graph.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "and it can also be written as a [transition matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_matrix).  In this matrix, each number represents the probability that, if the chain is currently in the state of the row, it will transition to the state in the column.  The weather model as a transition matrix is:\n",

What this means is that if we calculated the probabilities to move between these states, we could make a transition matrix that represents the entire riddle, starting from 0 tickets to the time when all drivers are suspended.\n",

    "\n",

    "* $$[0 \\dots 0]$$ just shows that the bottom row is all 0 except the last column\n",
    "\n",
    "Observation **3** is critical because absorbing Markov chains have special properties that **allow for direct calculation of the expected number of steps to reach an absorbing state, starting from any other state**.  Because our absorbing state is that all drivers are suspended, and we can start with all drivers having 0 tickets, this is exactly what we're trying to calculate!\n",

    "## Feeling lucky?\n",
    "\n",
    "The next important part of our solution is calculating the probability that a driver receives a ticket.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that for each trip, there are $$x$$ available drivers, where $$x$$ is the number of drivers that do not have 3 tickets.  This means each driver has a $$\\frac{1}{x}$$ chance of being selected to drive that trip.  Additionally, we know that each driver has a probability $$p$$ that they will receive a ticket *if they drive*.  This means that for each trip, *before the driver is selected*, the probability that an individual driver will be ticketed is $$\\frac{1}{x} \\times p$$. For example, assume the state is `[1, 1, 2, 0]`.  All 4 drivers are available, so $$x$$=4.  Driver C's $$p$$ is 0.20.  This makes Driver C's probability of receiving a ticket $$\\frac{0.20}{4} = 0.05$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the state was `[3, 1, 2, 0]` instead, Driver C would be more likely to receive a ticket because it's more likely they will be selected at random to drive!  Their ticket probability is now $$\\frac{0.20}{3} = 0.067$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because tickets cannot be taken away, and only 1 can be issued per trip, transitions are only possible between two states where exactly 1 ticket has been issued to exactly 1 driver, or no tickets have been issued.  The probability that no ticket will been issued can be found by adding all the probabilities that each individual driver will receive a ticket and subtracting that from 1."
