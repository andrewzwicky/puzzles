    "> &nbsp;  \n",
    "> Our co-workers carpool to work each day. A driver is selected randomly for the drive to work and again randomly for the drive home. Each of the drivers has a lead foot, and each has a chance of being ticketed for speeding. Driver A has a 10 percent chance of getting a ticket each time he drives, Driver B a 15 percent chance, Driver C a 20 percent chance, and Driver D a 25 percent chance. The state will immediately revoke the license of a driver after his or her third ticket, and a driver will stop driving in the carpool once his license is revoked. Since there is only one police officer on the carpool route, a maximum of one ticket will be issued per morning and a max of one per evening.    \n",

    "# What do we know?\n",
    "First, let's make some observations about the problem.  At the beginning of each trip, each driver will have some amount of tickets.  I'm going to refer to these amounts as a **state**.  For example, if Drivers A & B each had 1 ticket, I'll write that state as `[1, 1, 0, 0]`. The intial state is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. There are a limited number of states\n",
    "Each driver starts with 0 tickets and stops receiving them after their 3rd.  Because there is a cap on the amount of tickets, and a fixed number of drivers, there is a finite number of ways that tickets can be distributed amongst our drivers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual number of states is the number of ways that 0, 1, 2, or 3 can be arranged, with repetition, across the 4 drivers.  With 4 possible ticket amounts over 4 drivers, this will result in $$4^4$$ or 256 unique states.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. The probability for a driver to be ticketed depends only on the state at that time\n",
    "If Driver A and Driver B each have 1 ticket, the probability that Driver C will receive a ticket is the same no matter which order A and B received their tickets.  The only factors that influence each driver's probability of receiving a ticket are:\n",
    "* the number of eligible drivers (more drivers means it's less likely that any particular driver will need to drive)\n",
    "* their individual ticket probability\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. The end state can be reached from any other state\n",
    "The end state is the one where all drivers have received their maximum number of tickets, `[3, 3, 3, 3]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If I selected any possible distribution of tickets, it's possible to reach the end state by issuing more tickets.  No matter which state we pick, we can always make our way to the end state in a finite number of steps.  This is probably the most abstract of all of these observations, but it's important to the solution, so stick around!"

    "# Why do those matter?\n",
    "\n",
    "These observations are important because they provide some restrictions on how our scenario works.  These restrictions mean that a [Markov chain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain) might be a good method to solve this problem.  A *Markov process* is a process with some randomness that doesn't depend on previous state, i.e. it is \"memoryless\".  A *Markov chain* is a way to represent one of these processes, given it has a finite number of states.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common example of a Markov chain is the board game [Snakes & Ladders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_Ladders#Gameplay) because:  \n",
    "1. rolling dice to move around the board has randomness\n",
    "2. there are a limited number of spaces on the board\n",
    "3. the probability to move to a new space don't depend on how you arrived at your current space.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Markov chains are good at modeling board games involving dice.  Analyses exist for at least Risk[^risk], Monopoly[^monopoly], and Snakes & Ladders[^snl][^snl2].\n",
    "\n",
    "In our riddle, observation **2** provides the \"memoryless\" criteria and observation **1** shows that there is a finite number of states.  It's looking good that we could use Markov chains to solve our riddle.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### example Markov chain\n",
    "Let's pretend tomorrow's weather depends *only* on today's weather, and there are only two types of weather: **rainy** or **sunny**[^weather].  The weather follows these patterns:\n",
    "* If it's sunny today, tommorow's weather is: \n",
    "  * 90% likely to remain sunny.\n",
    "  * 10% likely to turn rainy.\n",

    "Now we need to start calculating probabilities.  In particular, we're interested in the probability that a driver gets a ticket, given an initial state.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that for each trip, there are $$x$$ available drivers, where $$x$$ is the number of drivers that do not have 3 tickets.  This means each eligible driver has a $$\\frac{1}{x}$$ chance of being selected to drive that trip.  Additionally, we know that each driver has a probability $$p$$ that they will receive a ticket *if they drive*.  This means that for each trip, *before the driver is selected*, the probability that an individual driver will be ticketed is $$\\frac{1}{x} \\times p$$. For example, assume the state is `[1, 1, 2, 0]`.  All 4 drivers are available, so $$x$$=4.  Driver C's $$p$$ is 0.20.  This makes Driver C's probability of receiving a ticket $$\\frac{0.20}{4} = 0.05$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the state was `[3, 1, 2, 0]` instead, Driver C would be more likely to receive a ticket because it's more likely they will be selected at random to drive!  Their ticket probability is now $$\\frac{0.20}{3} = 0.067$$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Transitions are only possible between two states where exactly 1 ticket has been issued to exactly 1 driver, or no tickets have been issued.  The probability that no ticket will been issued can be found by summing all the probabilities that each individual driver will be ticketed and subtracting that from 1."
