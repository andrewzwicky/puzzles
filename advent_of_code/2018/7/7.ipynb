The region is too hilly to see the North Pole from here, but you do spot some Elves that seem to be trying to unpack something that washed ashore. It's quite cold out, so you decide to risk creating a paradox by asking them for directions.\n",

You see, believe it or not, this box contains something that will solve all of Santa's transportation problems - at least, that's what it looks like from the pictures in the instructions.\" It doesn't seem like they can read whatever language it's in, but you can: \"Sleigh kit.

    "The instructions specify a series of steps and requirements about which steps must be finished before others can begin (your puzzle input). Each step is designated by a single letter. For example, suppose you have the following instructions:\n",

    "Step C must be finished before step A can begin.\n",
    "Step C must be finished before step F can begin.\n",
    "Step A must be finished before step B can begin.\n",

    "\n",
    "    Only C is available, and so it is done first.\n",
    "    Next, both A and F are available. A is first alphabetically, so it is done next.\n",
    "    Then, even though F was available earlier, steps B and D are now also available, and B is the first alphabetically of the three.\n",
    "    After that, only D and F are available. E is not available because only some of its prerequisites are complete. Therefore, D is completed next.\n",
    "    F is the only choice, so it is done next.\n",
    "    Finally, E is completed.\n",
